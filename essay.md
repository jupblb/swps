## What is ADHD?

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is, in oversimplified
explanation, a condition that makes it harder for individuals to focus on
something for a longer period of time. It's not uncommon to have it as 6% of all
children aged 3-17 years in the USA are diagnosed with it. [@adhd-cdc] Around
one-third of them continue to have it in adulthood. [@adhd-adulthood-rate]

Interestignly, the "hyperactivity" keyword may be somewhat misleading. The
society commonly uses term "ADHD" to describe people with too much energy in
them. In reality, it is also applicable to people with seemingly too little
energy, which results in plain inattention. And sometimes both interpretations
can be used to describe a single person.

Children with the disorder may have more difficulties in their education than
their classmates. It is a common behavior to seek new stimuli when performing an
either too easy or too difficult task. [@adhd-education-1] A teacher may also
misinterpret lack of attention as laziness, which later becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy. And even a diagnosed condition may have consequences
such as increased probability of suffering from bias or exclusion.
